### Backend
⚒ The heavy work is done here.

We are using a Python web framework called Fast API which is great for quickly creating Web APIs, including documentation.

[🧠 Learn more about Fast API](https://docs.tweetbrain.tisuela.com/backend/fastapi/)

All configuration files (e.g. `requirements.txt`) are within `tweetbrain/backend`, with the Fast API files within `tweetbrain/backend/app`.

### Front End
✨ The pretty work is done here.

We are using React to develop the front end (no specific framework chosen).

[🧠 Learn more about React](https://docs.tweetbrain.tisuela.com/frontend/react/)

All configuation files (e.g. `package.json`) are in `tweetbrain/frontend`, with the React.js files within `tweetbrain/frontend/src`.
